Our group developed an excellent process for completing the successful transcription and TEI encoding of several pages from a Shelley manuscript, in preparation for its future implementation into the Shelley-Godwin Archive. From the start, the group committed itself to open dialogue and clear communication, sharing contact information and establishing an email thread including all group members at the first meeting.

The group’s process relied on each member serving as an expert steward of her or his assigned page. Each member was assigned 1-2 pages to take ownership of. This allowed each member to gain detailed knowledge of a relatively small body of manuscript material. Throughout the first several weeks of the project, each member focused on enriching her assigned page with the techniques and TEI features introduced during class. During class meetings and via email, members communicated throughout this phase to lend assistance to each other as needed and troubleshoot problems.

The key to our group’s approach, however, was its ability to collaborate in the final days of the project using GitHub and peer revision. We defined a 24-hour revision period and assigned each member another member’s work to review. Revision partners then communicated one-on-one to provide detailed feedback. In the last days of the project, the team communicated extensively through the initial email thread, escalating encoding issues, such as indentations and using the mod tag, to the full group for resolution as needed. With all of these elements combined, our group used the greatest capacity of our resources in each other, the TEI presentations and all other available knowledge.

The success of this project, then, ultimately rested on the group’s ability to balance individual contribution with meaningful collaboration.
